# Seesaw Simulation

A technical web simulation that demonstrates physics principles through an interactive interface using vanilla JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3.

## Live Demo

## Project Overview
This project simulates a physical seesaw where users place weights (1-10kg) to observe real-time equilibrium changes. The development focus was on modular code structure, state management, and accurate torque-based physics.

## Core Features
- Real-time physics engine based on net torque calculation.
- Dark and Light mode support using CSS variables and data attributes.
- Data persistence with LocalStorage for both object states and theme preferences.
- Responsive layout adapting to mobile and desktop viewports.
- Real-time UI feedback for weight totals and tilt angles.
- Auditory feedback upon object placement.

## Physics Implementation
The simulation determines the plank's tilt by calculating the torque generated by each object relative to the center pivot.

### Core Calculation Logic
The following logic is implemented within the `updateSeesawPhysics` function:

1. **Torque Calculation:** For each object, torque is calculated as:
   > `torque = weight * Math.abs(distance_from_center)`

2. **Directional Torque:**
   - If `distance < 0`: Added to `leftTorque` and `leftWeight`.
   - If `distance > 0`: Added to `rightTorque` and `rightWeight`.

3. **Net Torque and Rotation:**
   ```javascript
   torqueDifference = rightTorque - leftTorque;
   angle = torqueDifference / 50;
   // Final angle is clamped between -30 and 30 degrees
   clampedAngle = Math.max(-30, Math.min(30, angle));

4. **Visual Update:**
   The plank's rotation is updated dynamically using: 
   seesawPlank.style.transform = `rotate(${angle}deg)`;

## Technical Stack
- HTML5: Semantic markup for simulation area and control panels.
- CSS3: Custom variables for theme management and Flexbox for UI alignment.
- JavaScript (ES6+): 
    - DOM API for dynamic object creation and manipulation.
    - LocalStorage API for session persistence.
    - Logic for random object generation (weight, shape, color).
